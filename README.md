Overview:

The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application designed to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in selecting the most suitable crops for cultivation based on various environmental and soil parameters. The system leverages historical data and predictive modeling to provide recommendations that can enhance crop yield and optimize resource utilization.

Features:
Data Ingestion: Collects and processes data from various sources, including soil quality, weather conditions, and historical crop performance.
Predictive Modeling: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict the most suitable crops for a given set of conditions.
User Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for users to input data and receive recommendations.
Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets and can be scaled for use in different regions with varying agricultural conditions.

Requirements:
Python , juypter notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, flask (for web interface), matplotlib (for data visualization), and other dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
